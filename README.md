## ðŸŸ¢ Green â€“ Construction Utilities
- Front and rear utility rings to assist during the epoxy phase.
- Although the original build guide recommends epoxying both centering rings to the motor tube, this limits access for fin bonding.
- **Recommended process**:
  1. Epoxy **only the front centering ring** to the motor tube.
  2. Insert the motor tube into the body tube with fins.
  3. Use the two green utility rings to align and press the fins flush against the airframe.
  4. Apply epoxy fillets to the fins from the inside (rear).
- The final green piece is a **stand** to support your rocket during **painting**.

## ðŸ”´ Red â€“ Rail Button Rings
- Only part intended to remain on the rocket during flight.
- Designed to mount standard rail buttons using **M3 x 16mm machine screws** (avoid wood screws).
- When finalizing your fin epoxy work, insert the **rear rail button ring ahead of the rear centering ring** â€” it should align perfectly with your fins.

## ðŸŸ  Orange â€“ Display Stands
- Snap-in stands to support your fully assembled rocket in a vertical position for storage or display.
